## My approach
I used noSQL database mongoDB to create Product with one record that contains all items as objects. I created four requests:
1. For Initial synchronization
2. For secondary synchronization
3. To reset all data
4. To list all product's items
I used rubocop to make sure that the code meets acceptable standards.

Looking forward to get some feedback! ðŸ˜ƒ
